# CoC and License

   We chose the Contributor Covenant as our CoC because it highlights a safe and respectful environment. This environment is meant to promote collaboration. It also provides a way for users to report unacceptable behavior and outlines how people who do not follow the code of conduct can be punished. 
    
   We chose the MIT License because it was the least restrictive. We have no intent to profit off of our software and do not care if others do. The only thing we want to promote is collaboration.
